# AI Song Lyrics Assistant

This is a project that explores how AI can be used to enhance the songwriting process. It is built on GPT-3

## Technologies used

- GPT-3
- Typescript/Javascript
- Next.js
- React.js

## Progress

V1 is complete, offering a simple tool that generates 5 ideas for possible song verses when given a scenario. Under the hood, it will take the scenario it is given (e.g. "I am watching the sunset on the beach") and it will generate five song ideas. Using promt chaining, it will then generate a verse for each of the five song ideas it generated.

Next steps:

V2 will allow users to submit more details about the specific genre, style and inspirations for their song. The app will then generate verse recommendations with music theory suggestions (for example, it could suggest a verse and say that that verse would go well with minor chord progressions and orchestral instrumentation).

V3 will allow users to ask for suggestions around musical aspects of the song, for example aksing for possible chord variations or musical instruments for a given verse. It will also give suggestions to users on how to rephrase existing verses, for example taking an incomplete verse and making it rhyme.
